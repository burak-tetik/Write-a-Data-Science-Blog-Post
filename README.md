# Data Science Without Degree?

### Medium Blog Post
Here is the Medium blog post I have written: https://medium.com/@burak_tetik/data-science-without-degree-e42ede251c65


### Project Motivation
This project (Write a Data Science Blog Post) is part of Udacity Data Scientists Nanodegree Program.

I used Stack Overflow Data - 2017 Survey: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/stackoverflow/so-survey-2017

In this notebook I will try to answer the following questions:
1) Do developers with no university degree love their careers more than other developers?
2) Which countries have the most and the least developers working without a bachelor’s or higher degree?
3) Is there any significant salary difference between people who have a university degree and who have not? If so, how much?
4) What is the overall ratio of the developers that are employed even though they don’t have any bachelor’s degree?

### Libraries
I use Python3. Here are the libraries I used in my Jupyter Notebook:
1. Numpy
2. Pandas
3. Seaborn
4. matplotlib.pyplot
